Backend folder has the folder structures only, i don't have the codes yet because last time i created it i got spaghetti codes and got lost on doing the logics.
On the Frontend folder go to the src folder and find login.jsx or the login page you can see that i got axios it is used for making http req. and i also got usestate
it is for modal and for the password and email as i have said i got lost on doing the backend so i created a new one.
Feel free to ask questions once you see the structures and the codes, thanks.
